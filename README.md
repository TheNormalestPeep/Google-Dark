# Google-Dark
A dark mode for google designed for the Stylus extension.

This is a modification of Google's CSS for a darker theme. It requires that you have the chrome extension [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en).

I do have plans in the future for the other parts of google I missed, as well as services such as Gmail and Google Translate.

You are free to modify the code for private use ONLY, but under no exceptions may you redistribute it.

EDIT: This project has been abandoned. Why do you have to keep changing your CSS every 3 seconds, google...
